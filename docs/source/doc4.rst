=====================
example
=====================

The program launches with the following command:
  python3 main.py fast5_directory_name albacore_log_file_name

*albacore_log_file_name*: the name of run where the log file is present(ex.20170328_FAF04250)

Afterwards two directories are created:

* statistics containing statistics for each barcode
* images containing the images generated by the script. It will serve to create the report

Then two files are also created:

 * a report.docx containing a set of graphs generated by the script
 * a pdf file which contains the different graph in the case of some figures will be unreadable or not present in the docx

A file named layout.pdf is necessary. That file represent the layout of a minion flowcell.
It must be in the directory where the script is executed. This latter is present in the git directory.
